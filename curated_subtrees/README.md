This is the folder where you can find all subtrees (in tsv format) uploaded to the UniEuk taxonomy since the initial import from 11 June 2021, with an indication of the release they belong to.

This is also the directory where users can contribute new subtrees / tsv files by creating a draft (distinct branch in the GIT repository) that will trigger a pull request. Once a tsv file has been validated and the corresponding subtree has been imported in EukMap by the UniEuk Taxonomy Coordinator, the pull request is accepted (merged to the main branch in the GIT repository) and the tsv file become visible by all in this folder.

Detailed information about how to proceed can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/UniEuk/contributions/wiki).

The tsv file corresponding to the current (latest) release of the full taxonomy is in the [root directory](https://github.com/UniEuk/contributions).

# contributions

Welcome to the "UniEuk contributions" GitHub repository to build the UniEuk taxonomy in [EukMap](https://eukmap.unieuk.org).

Detailed information about EukMap, the curation workflow that is being implemented for it, and how to currently contribute to the taxonomy (via this GitHub repository) can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/UniEuk/contributions/wiki).

You can find the tsv (tab-delimited csv) file corresponding to the current (latest) version of the full taxonomy in this root folder (file 0.0.1_pre-release_UniEuk_starting_taxonomy_2021-06-11.tsv).

For the tsv files corresponding to all the subtrees imported since the initial starting taxonomy from 11 June 2021, go to [curated_subtrees](https://github.com/UniEuk/contributions/tree/main/curated_subtrees). This is also the directory where users will be creating / uploading new contributions.

For the tsv files corresponding to all previous releases of the taxonomy, go to [previous_releases](https://github.com/UniEuk/contributions/tree/main/previous_releases).

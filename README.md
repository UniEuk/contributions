Welcome to the github repository for the EukMap import files to build the UniEuk taxonomy!

You can find the tsv (tab-delimited csv) file corresponding to the current (latest) version of the full taxonomy in this root folder (0.0.1_pre-release_UniEuk_starting_taxonomy_2021-06-11.tsv).

For the tsv files corresponding to all the subtrees imported since the initial starting taxonomy from 11 June 2021, go to curated_subtrees. This also the directory where users will be creating / uploading new files.

For the tsv files corresponding to all previous releases of the taxonomy, go to previous_releases.

More detailed information about EukMap, the curation workflow, and how to contribute to the taxonomy (via GitHub) can be found in [Wiki](https://github.com/UniEuk/contributions/wiki).
